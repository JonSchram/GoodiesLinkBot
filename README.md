The frontend for this application uses JavaFX, so in order to run the program you will need JavaFX installed.
In order to make the rectangular selector always on top, Java version 8u20 or greater is required.

User interface is very minimal currently but it may be redesigned and allow tweaking of image processing parameters.

How to run:
The program is packaged in a jar file. These can usually be executed by double-clicking them in a file explorer, but can also be executed on the command line as follows:
java -jar <jar_file_name>

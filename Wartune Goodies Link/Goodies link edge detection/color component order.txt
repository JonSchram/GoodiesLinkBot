Obtained by taking a screenshot containing a large region of red, green, or blue and inspecting a section of the resulting byte array that was mainly 0 and -1.
The bytes were ensured to be at the start of a pixel by verifying the index is divisible by 4 (because each pixel takes 4 bytes)

By analyzing the pixel values, -1 (255 unsigned) is the fourth byte per pixel. Therefore the alpha component comes fourth.

The remaining nonzero byte for each image indicate the proper component: Red comes first, then green, then blue.
